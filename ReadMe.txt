This project relies on JAXB types generated by JDeveloper to support XML Facts.
The types are contained in the  .rulesdesigner   folder
These are the types that must be used to create input test data for xml facts

When running the RulesTest from within JDeveloper,
The .rulesdesign/Jaxb_classes folder must be added to project classpath so run of java test class will find the types.

Right click  on the project and choose properties->libraries and classpath->Add Jar Library
Add the .rulesdesigner\Jaxb_classes  folder

If the JAXB types class files are missing they can be generated by performing the following steps:
Open the project and navigate to the OracleRules1.rules file and double click the file.
In the rules editor window that appears, select the 'Facts' Tab on the upper left, then select the XML tab at the bottom.
Click the Blue circular arrow icon on the upper right.
This should cause the JAXB types needed for XML facts to be generated.

Finally the Classpath for the RulesProject must be corrected to point to the local location of the generated JAXB types.
When running the RulesTest from within JDeveloper,
The .rulesdesign/Jaxb_classes folder must be added to project classpath so run of java test class will find the types.
Right click  on the project and choose properties->libraries and classpath->Add Jar Library
Add the location of the local .rulesdesigner\Jaxb_classes  folder
Then remove the existing entry that came with the project, since it points to an incorrect location
